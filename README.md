## Installation

1. **Clone or download the files:**
```bash
# Download the main files to your working directory
# - architecture_review_agent.py
# - requirements.txt
# - standards/ directory with configuration files
```

2. **Install dependencies (optional):**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The agent works with Python's standard library, but optional dependencies provide enhanced functionality.

## Quick Start

### 1. Basic Review
```bash
python architecture_review_agent.py sample_architecture.md
```

### 2. Generate HTML Report
```bash
python architecture_review_agent.py sample_architecture.md --output report.html --format html
```

### 3. Specify Artifact Type
```bash
python architecture_review_agent.py my_doc.md --type solution_architecture --output review.json
```

## Configuration

### Standards Directory Structure
```
standards/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ review_rules.json          # Review criteria and patterns
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ architecture_patterns.json # Known architecture patterns
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ custom_standard.json      # Organization-specific standards
```

### Customizing Review Rules

Edit `standards/review_rules.json` to customize:

```json
{
  "security": {
    "patterns": ["authentication", "authorization", "encryption"],
    "severity": "critical",
    "minimum_coverage": 4,
    "weight": 35
  },
  "completeness": {
    "required_sections": [
      "executive_summary",
      "architecture_overview", 
      "security_considerations"
    ],
    "severity": "high"
  }
}
```

### Adding Architecture Patterns

Add new patterns to `standards/architecture_patterns.json`:

```json
{
  "my_pattern": {
    "description": "Custom architecture pattern",
    "characteristics": ["feature1", "feature2"],
    "best_practices": [
      "Best practice 1",
      "Best practice 2"
    ],
    "when_to_use": ["Use case 1", "Use case 2"]
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Basic review with console output
python architecture_review_agent.py architecture.md

# Generate detailed HTML report
python architecture_review_agent.py architecture.md -o report.html --format html

# Use custom standards directory
python architecture_review_agent.py doc.md --standards-dir ./my-standards

# Review specific artifact type
python architecture_review_agent.py doc.md --type technical_specification
```

### Programmatic Usage

```python
from architecture_review_agent import ArchitectureReviewAgent, ArtifactType

# Initialize agent
agent = ArchitectureReviewAgent(standards_dir="./standards")

# Load and review artifact
artifact = agent.load_artifact("architecture.md", ArtifactType.SOLUTION_ARCHITECTURE)
comments = agent.review_artifact(artifact)

# Generate report
report = agent.generate_review_report(artifact, comments)
print(f"Overall Score: {report['review_summary']['overall_score']}/100")

# Export report
agent.export_report(report, "review_report.html", "html")
```

        path: architecture-review.html
```

### Integration with Review Tools
```python
# Example integration with review management system
def integrate_with_review_system(artifact_path):
    agent = ArchitectureReviewAgent()
    artifact = agent.load_artifact(artifact_path)
    comments = agent.review_artifact(artifact)
    
    # Convert to review system format
    review_items = convert_to_review_format(comments)
    
    # Submit to review system
    review_system.create_review(artifact_path, review_items)
```

## Best Practices

### For Architecture Authors
1. **Follow Standard Structure**: Include all required sections identified by the agent
2. **Address Security Early**: Ensure security considerations are comprehensive
3. **Document Scalability**: Include scaling strategies and performance requirements
4. **Plan for Monitoring**: Specify observability and monitoring approaches
5. **Consider Compliance**: Address relevant regulatory requirements

### For Enterprise Architects
1. **Pre-Review Preparation**: Use preparation notes to focus review discussions
2. **Prioritize Critical Issues**: Address critical and high-severity issues first
3. **Reference Standards**: Use the agent's reference links to validate approaches
4. **Track Improvements**: Use scoring to measure architecture quality over time
